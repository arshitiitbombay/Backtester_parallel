# WEEK 3 CONTENT

This week, we will share a course on CUDA ( specifically NUMBA in Python ). This course has been made by NVIDIA themselves, and, on completition you will get a certificate.

After you have completed this course, we will provide an assignment to check your skills. Your skills will be metricised using the runtime and correctness. After which we will, using Numba, decrease the runtime of a simple backtester.

So, here's the process:

1. Watch the given video to get the basic nuances of a GPU and how does it work. This will help you as you go further into the project and nitty-gritties of CUDA.
