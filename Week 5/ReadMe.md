# WEEK 5

This week we will be shifting our focus a little towards options (and derivatives). Parse through the content is as follows :

- Week_5_content : A conscise readme about what are options. Also go to the link in the file to understand it better.
- Options_backtest : A readme sowing the complexity of building an options backtester.
- Modelling_techniques : A readme introduction to Black-Scholes and Binomial Model for simulating option prices.

# Assignment :

We have given the backtesting code. The assignment is as follows:

- Incorporate Black-Scholes in the European Market and backtest at least 3 strategies.

        OR
  
- Incorporate the Binomial Model in the American Market and backtest at least 3 strategies.

The assignment will follow the given flow:

- Dowload Market Data ( For American one you already have it )
- Apply the model yoou have chosen (be strict to the markets and model specification otherwise your strategies won't work)
- Show the result in your github
