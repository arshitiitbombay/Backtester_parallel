# Week 5 – Options Trading

This week focuses on understanding **Options Trading**, including how options work, the key types, and how they differ from other financial instruments like futures and forwards.

## What Are Options?

Options are financial contracts that give the **holder the right—but not the obligation**—to **buy** or **sell** an underlying asset at a predetermined **strike price**, on or before a specified **expiration date**.

Options are a type of **derivative**, meaning their value is derived from the price of an underlying asset such as a stock, index, or commodity.

> Options are often used for hedging risk or speculating on price movements with limited capital. However, they carry inherent risk and time sensitivity.

## Key Terminology

- **Strike Price**: The price at which the option can be exercised.
- **Expiration Date**: The last date on which the option can be exercised.
- **Premium**: The cost paid by the buyer to acquire the option contract.
- **In the Money (ITM)**: When exercising the option would be profitable.
- **Out of the Money (OTM)**: When exercising the option would result in a loss.
- **Time Decay**: The reduction in an option's value as it approaches expiration.

## Call vs. Put Options

| Feature            | Call Option                        | Put Option                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Buyer’s Right     | Buy the underlying asset           | Sell the underlying asset           |
| Profit When       | Price goes up                      | Price goes down                     |
| Maximum Loss      | Limited to premium paid            | Limited to premium paid             |
| Maximum Gain      | Theoretically unlimited             | Limited to asset price falling to 0 |
| Seller’s Obligation| Must sell if exercised (ITM)      | Must buy if exercised (ITM)         |
| Risk to Seller    | Potentially unlimited              | High, but not unlimited             |

## Characteristics of Options

- **Limited Risk for Buyers**: Maximum loss equals the premium paid.
- **High Risk for Sellers**: Sellers are obligated to fulfill the contract if exercised, potentially incurring large or unlimited losses.
- **Time-Sensitive**: As the expiration date nears, options lose value (known as time decay).
- **Not Always Exercised**: Most option holders close their position before expiration by selling the contract.
- **Decaying Asset**: Options lose value over time if no favorable price movement occurs.

## Options as Insurance

Options can act like an insurance policy:

- The **buyer pays a premium** for protection against an adverse price movement.
- If the risk does not materialize, the option expires worthless.
- If it does, the buyer exercises the option to minimize loss or profit from the move.

This concept is why prominent investors like Warren Buffett often sell options, collecting premiums similar to an insurance company collecting monthly payments.

## American vs. European Options

| Feature               | American Options                | European Options                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Exercise Timing       | Any time before expiration       | Only at expiration              |
| Flexibility           | More flexible                    | Less flexible                   |
| Common In             | U.S. markets                     | European markets                |

---

## Misconceptions

- **Buying both a call and a put** does not guarantee profit. Premiums can erode returns unless there is a significant price movement in one direction.
- Options trading is not a foolproof strategy. Risk and timing play a crucial role in profitability.

---

## Example Scenario

You believe there's a 30% chance that a stock will fall:

- You buy a **put option** as a hedge.
- If the stock falls, you can exercise the put and profit from the price drop.
- If it rises, you lose only the premium paid.

## Futures and Forwards (Brief Overview)

While options provide the **right but not the obligation** to transact, **futures** and **forwards** are contracts that **obligate** both parties to transact at a set price at a future date.

### Futures

- Standardized contracts traded on exchanges.
- Require a margin deposit.
- Marked to market daily.
- Lower counterparty risk due to clearing houses.

### Forwards

- Private, customizable contracts traded over-the-counter (OTC).
- Higher counterparty risk.
- Settled only at maturity.
- Common in commodities and currencies.

### Comparison to Options

| Feature           | Options                         | Futures / Forwards                |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Obligation       | Only for the seller              | Both parties are obligated        |
| Risk for Buyer   | Limited to premium               | Potentially unlimited             |
| Use Case         | Hedging, speculation             | Hedging, arbitrage, speculation   |
| Time Decay       | Yes                              | No                                |
