# Options Backtester

## Overview

Developing an options backtester is significantly more complex than creating a traditional backtester for stocks. This is primarily because option availability is time-sensitive and historical options data is often incomplete or unavailable. Therefore, building a robust backtester for options requires a dynamic framework that can simulate option markets and adapt to the evolving nature of derivative instruments.

Unlike traditional backtesters where portfolio metrics can be evaluated using straightforward formulas (e.g., compound interest), options-based strategies require an event-driven simulation loop. At each time step, decisions must be made based on the current market state, available options, and the portfolio's current holdings and risk exposure.

## Complexity of Options Strategies

Options strategies can be highly dynamic and involve conditional decision-making. For instance, consider the following scenario:

- You purchased a stock at ₹90.
- You sold a ₹70 put option.
- The stock falls to ₹74, exposing you to potential assignment if it drops below ₹70 at expiry.

To mitigate losses:

1. You buy additional shares at ₹74.
2. If assigned, you already hold the necessary shares and deliver them at ₹70 (taking a ₹4 loss per share).
3. When the price rebounds to ₹85 or ₹90, you can sell the remaining holdings to recover value.

Originally, the potential loss might have been ₹20 * n. However, with this mitigation, the loss is reduced to ₹(4 + 5) * n, which is significantly better.

## Required Inputs for the Strategy

An options backtester must process a comprehensive set of inputs at each timestamp. These may include:

- Timestamp
- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume
- Synthetic options chain (generated using pricing models)
- Portfolio holdings (including purchase prices of stocks)
- Current PnL
- Cash balance
- Historical volatility estimates
- Transaction costs (optional)

## Generating Options Data

Since historical options chains may not be readily available for backtesting purposes, models such as the Black-Scholes or Binomial Option Pricing Models can be used to simulate realistic options pricing based on historical equity data. This allows the backtester to present a synthetic but consistent set of options for strategy evaluation.

## Execution Model

The backtesting framework typically operates in a loop across time, where:

1. Market and options data are updated.
2. The strategy is called to decide on actions (e.g., buy/sell stock or options).
3. Portfolio state, cash balance, and unrealized PnL are updated accordingly.
4. Metrics such as drawdown, exposure, and risk-adjusted returns are tracked.

## Conclusion

Building an options backtester involves carefully simulating both the market environment and the options ecosystem. Strategies must be tested in a dynamic environment with continuously evolving portfolios and market conditions. With the use of pricing models and robust portfolio tracking, a realistic and flexible backtesting system for derivatives trading can be achieved.
