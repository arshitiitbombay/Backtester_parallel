# Week 2: Work and Assignments

We have uploaded a simple backtester. Some specifications about it:
- It is a research backtester. Generally used to check if an alpha is useful or not.
- It has been made using a lot of assumptions

## Methodology of using the files:
### Step 0: Download All Files in a Folder

### Step 1: Downloading data
- Open "Get_data_from_yahoo.ipynb". Some 504 CSV files should be generated

### Step 2: Using already made Bakctester
- Use "Conversion.ipynb" to convert the already present data at hand. We are converting the data for the backtester's need.
- Use "main.ipynb" to test a given strategy

### Step 3: Backtester making and Assignment
- The "Backtester.ipynb" file contains incomplete code of a backtester. Your aim is to complete it and implement at least 3 strategies

## Assignment :
The assignment is as follows:
- Play with the backtester and try generating new alphas
- To create more alphas, you might need extra features, so try creating it using already given features like high, close, etc. An example is returns can be estimated using open and close prices.
- If you face difficulties making alphas here, try it on the WorldQuant Brain Platform
      https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/sign-in
- Example alphas will be there , and also a tutorial to make alphas will also be there. (No need to complete full tutorial, basic understanding will be fine)
- After you are comfortable with making alphas, complete the backtester.ipynb file
